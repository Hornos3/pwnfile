Jack has developed a malicout analysis tool and leave a backdoor in it.

Can you hack the tool and get shell?

You can send the base64 of bitcode to the server, and the server will decode it and run "./opt -load ./SAPass.so -SAPass ./exp.bcâ€œyour_bitcode".

You can directly use the following script to send base64 code to server:


from pwn import *
import sys
context.log_level='debug'

con = remote(sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2])
f = open("./exp.bc","rb")

payload=f.read()

f.close()

payload2 = payload.encode("base64")
con.sendlineafter("bitcode: \n", payload2)

con.interactive()
